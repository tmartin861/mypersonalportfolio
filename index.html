        <img src="selfphoto.jpg" alt="Profile Photo">
        <p>Motivated military professional and junior Java software developer with experience in Java and Spring Boot programming languages, I have honed my skills through a combination of academic study and real-world projects. With five years of highly diverse technical training and experience, I have developed a strong foundation in leading and mentoring team members, troubleshooting multiple complex technologies, organizational and logistics planning, and attention to detail.

            In addition to my technical expertise, I possess a strong work ethic and the ability to adapt to new challenges, consistently delivering high-quality work under pressure. My passion for software development, coupled with my military background, has instilled in me the importance of teamwork, perseverance, and effective communication. I believe these qualities are invaluable in any software development role and contribute to the overall success of a project.

            As a junior Java developer, I am eager to continue expanding my knowledge and sharpening my programming skills, always staying up-to-date with industry trends and best practices. I am confident that my background, skill set, and dedication to learning make me an ideal candidate for any team looking to develop innovative and effective software solutions.

            If you're looking for a dedicated and skilled software developer to join your team, I would welcome the opportunity to speak with you.
